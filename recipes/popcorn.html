    <!-- ingredients -->
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup dry popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp oil of choice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot (we prefer stainless steel) over high heat and ready a large bowl for serving. Once the pot is hot (test by sprinkling in some water — it should sizzle), reduce the heat slightly to medium-high and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil. Immediately add 1/2 cup (120 g) popcorn kernels and a healthy pinch of salt. Using oven mitts, shake the pan back and forth to coat.</li>
        <li>Once the first couple of kernels start popping, cover with a lid and shake every 10 seconds to allow the unpopped kernels to settle to the bottom. Continue shaking every 10 seconds until the popping has mostly stopped, about 45-60 seconds. Transfer immediately to the large bowl and sprinkle with 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Discard any burnt kernels — there shouldn't be any, but if there are, that usually means the heat was too low or the popcorn was left on the stovetop too long.</li>
        <li>Enjoy as is or sprinkle with seasonings of choice. We like nutritional yeast or dried rosemary and garlic powder.</li>
    </ol>
