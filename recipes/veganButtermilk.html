    <h3>Have a favorite recipe that calls for buttermilk, but want to make it vegan or dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>This recipe is the 2-ingredient, 5-minute solution.</p>

    <!-- ingredients -->
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened, plain dairy-free milk</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- directions -->
    <h3>directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine lemon juice with almond milk to make “vegan buttermilk.” Set aside for a few minutes — it should curdle slightly. It won’t thicken like buttermilk, but it has a similar effect in recipes.</li>
        <li>Use in vegan ranch, biscuits (or gluten-free biscuits), or anywhere else that calls for buttermilk. Best when fresh, but it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days and stirred before using.</li>
    </ol>
